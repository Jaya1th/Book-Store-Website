I developed a **Book Store** application using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** to create a seamless online book shopping experience. The backend, built with **Node.js and Express**, handled CRUD operations for books, user authentication, and order management. **MongoDB** was used to store book details, user data, and purchase history efficiently. The frontend, built with **React**, provided an intuitive UI for browsing books, adding them to the cart. This project strengthened my expertise in **full-stack development, RESTful APIs, and database management**.
